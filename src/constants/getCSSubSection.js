            <p className="p">
              In 2015 Petersham Nurseries wanted to expand to central London. We
              were responsible to the founding family to lead the corporate and
              financial strategy along with start-up operations for the Covent
              Garden complex comprising of 2 restaurants, retail store and deli
              around its central Floral Court courtyard.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              We led a large team of over 100 employees in preparation of the
              concept, brand identity and operating structure that secured the
              15,000 sq ft location. We negotiated lease terms, prepared the
              business plan and managed corporate finance. This included
              establishing a corporate structure, licensing/ trademark strategy,
              financing, construction and resourcing.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              We supervised a complicated and shifting design and construction
              fit-out program within a Grade II listed building, coordinating
              with the landlord and their construction team that was
              refurbishing the base-build core & shell.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              Thereafter we secured the premises license, lead the hiring of key
              management, department heads and operative personnel, then managed
              finance and operations through to a very successful launch in
              2017.

            <h4 className="h4 h4--lh">Old Spitalfields Market</h4>
            <p className="p">
              When the owner of Old Spitalfields Market was ready to refurbish
              the market, we presented an architectural scheme for our vision of
              a central shared multi-unit kitchen surrounded by movable retail
              stalls within the historic Victorian perimeter, as part of a
              placemaking strategy that included events.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              We worked with Foster + Partners and renowned Chef Nuno Mendes on
              the development of the technical designs for the kitchen and
              retail units. Preferred specialists from our network managed
              construction budgets/ program, MEP and equipment installation.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              We also crafted the sales and marketing strategy which was
              implemented by our team that created the website and marketing
              collateral, culminating with the leading ranking for all London
              markets.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              We sourced strategic operators and secured high profile events
              such as the first physical Instagram market that shaped the
              identity of the market,which was recognized as the CBRE top 10
              European Foodhall and the only UK entrant.
            </p>
            <p className="p">
              The success of the market led to high occupancy and construction
              of additional leasable space in the historic perimeter attracting
              valuable high covenant strength tenants.
